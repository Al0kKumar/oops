class => is a user defined data type . eg Hero Alok - here Hero is class and Alok is a object with all properties and 
behaviour of class Hero

object => instance of class 


constructor => its a way of allocating some values in the object during the process of object creation-> with parameterised constructor
constructor and destructor both names are same as of the class , both are called only once during creation and deletion of object
for both respectively


default copy constructor => shallow copy of a object is copied , it means that if the object from which new object in copied ,
if there is any change in the values of the properties then it will change in all its copies 


userdefined copy constructor => deep copy is made 


destructor => its work is to deallocate the memory as the object scope ends
